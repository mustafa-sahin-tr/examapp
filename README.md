## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd examapp
```

2. Start the application with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will spin up all the required services. For development use, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

### Accessing Services

Once the application is running, you can access the following services:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)

## Development

### Frontend Development

The frontend is built with Angular 19. To start development:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
ng serve
```

### Backend Development

The backend services are .NET Core applications:

```bash
cd api
dotnet run --project ExamApp.Api
```

### Running Tests

For the frontend:

```bash
cd ui
ng test
```

For load testing, K6 is configured:

```bash
docker-compose run k6 run /home/k6/testfiles/k6-script.js
```

## Configuration

Each service has its own configuration in the respective Docker Compose files and application settings.
